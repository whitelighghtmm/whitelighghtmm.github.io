<h3 class="faq">1. Am I Choosing The Right Therapy For My Child?</h3>

      What is ABA? What is the difference between your ABA-VB and what other therapy centers offer? <span style="float: right"><i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></span></a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">ABA stands for Applied Behavioral Analysis, which is backed by over 45 years of scientific evidence of its benefits. ABA is the primary form of early intervention used in the United States and Canada. It is also endorsed by the U.S. Surgeon General as the best form of treatment for autism.
Verbal Behavior, which we call ABA-VB, is considered to be a modern and evolved ABA approach that focuses on naturalistic teaching with a strong focus on language development. We hold the distinction of being closely guided by Dr. James Partington, a world-renowned expert in ABA-VB. We also have two BCBAs (Board-Certified Behavioral Analysts) on staff.
You may have encountered many different therapy providers in your search for early intervention, all promising successful outcomes. However, we do advise that you consider their training and curriculum carefully. Some providers mix ABA together with other therapy approaches. While they may claim that they are using the best of the different methodologies, beware that they may not be implementing any of them correctly as intended. ABA therapy is a discipline and requires precise implementation to achieve maximum results.

      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">When it comes to autism treatment, there are a number of different methodologies out there that differ in philosophy. However, when it comes down to scientific data and evidence-based results, ABA is backed by 40 years of research and numerous studies, all of which have concluded that intensive ABA is the best choice of therapy for children with autism.
Verbal Behavior (ABA-VB) is widely considered as being the most modern and updated form of ABA. While other providers may claim to practice ABA-VB, we are the only provider that is directly guided and trained by a VB pioneer, Dr. James Partington.</div>

        What is the best age to start an ABA program? What is the age range you work with?<span style="float: right"><i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></span></a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">There is no minimum age for starting an ABA program. In fact, the earlier you start therapy, the better your outcomes will be, as shown by research. For this reason, most early intervention programs around the world are designed for children between the age of 2 to 5.
That said, ABA can benefit children of all ages, so don’t hesitate to reach out about an older child. It’s never too late to learn! The upper range of the children we work with is 12-13, although we do have teenagers in our weekly Social Thinking program.

			</h4>
		</div>
		<div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body">Every child that comes through our doors has unique strengths and challenges, be they developmental, behavioral or social in nature. No “one size fits all” approach can succeed when it comes to intervention. That is why each and every program is customized to meet your child’s specific profile and needs.
If your child is non-verbal, we will place the focus on early learner skills such as ‘manding’, which teaches a child that language is meaningful and has the power to fulfill his needs. If your child has frequent meltdowns in public, we will find out what their triggers are and find ways to teach your child self-regulation. For a verbal child who has difficulty socializing, we will prioritize play and social skills. These are examples of how individual programs can vary depending on the profile of the child we work with.
The difference that ABA-VB makes is that it is naturalistic and oriented around your child’s personality and interests. It is the opposite of a “robotic” approach that compels children to repeat tasks over and over regardless of their interest.

			</h4>
		</div>
		<div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body">Many of the children we work with attend EIPIC and ABA-VB at the same time. The reality for many families is that the number of subsidized therapy hours they receive weekly is insufficient to bring about the dramatic results that they wish to see, which is why they supplement with ABA-VB to create a more intensive program. We understand that these are the needs of our local families and would be glad to collaborate with you or your EIPIC providers to achieve common goals for your child.</div>

<h3 class="faq">2. How Much Therapy Does My Child Need?</h3>

      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">Research studies have indicated that 30 to 40 hours of ABA produce the best outcomes for children with ASD. This recommendation is based on studies done in the 1980s that showed that about 50% of children receiving 40 hours of ABA therapy a week went on to lose all symptoms of ASD and become indistinguishable from typical children of the same age.
While we recommend 30 to 40 hours of therapy, we understand that not all parents are able to afford therapy of this intensity. We strongly recommend, however, that you commit to at least 15 hours a week of ABA-VB so that you can see the difference intensive ABA-VB can make and the pace at which progress can take place.</div>

      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse7" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">How quickly you will see results will depend on many factors, such as the severity of your child’s delays and deficits, your child’s age, his or her traits and abilities, and the intensity of the therapy. Our immediate goal when first introducing ABA-VB is for our therapist to build rapport with your child. When that rapport and trust is established, it lays the groundwork for them to work together well.
Taking this into account, we would advise you to give the program at least three months to be working well.

      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse8" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">In short, the answer is “As long as you feel you need it.” Our longer answer is that your child will most likely require early intervention for at least two years, and possibly more. At ARN, we have worked with children that continued with us into their teens.
Our goal is always to have your child graduate from his or her program as soon as possible. Whether your child can do so depends on your child’s rate of learning and behavioral change, as well as your own expectations for your child (for example, if you want your child to go to mainstream school).
Many of our families find that even though their child has made significant progress, they are not ready to stop, so they instead reduce the intensity of therapy, and opt for secondary services such as our Social Thinking® program or after school support.

				Can Early Intervention really lead to recovery? Why do some children recover but others do not even after years of intensive ABA?<span style="float: right"><i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></span></a>
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div id="collapse9" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body">We are called Autism Recovery Network because we have seen so many cases of recovery over the years and deeply believe it is possible. However, it is a reality that only some children lose their diagnosis completely, and others do not, even after intensive ABA. Ultimately, Autism is an extremely complex disorder that the world still does not understand well at this point in time.
We know from research that there are some factors that lead to better outcomes, such as starting therapy at an early age, the intensity of the therapy, the involvement of parents and, of course, the methodology and quality of the therapy. However, there are also factors such as the severity of the developmental deficits, the child’s cognitive ability and the ability of the child that also affect progress.
Ultimately, we advise parents to focus on their child’s progress and their acquisition of new skills on the ABLLS-R® chart, which offers goals that are evidence-based, teachable, and trackable.

				Is it better to have high-intensity therapy for a short duration or low-intensity over a long period?<span style="float: right"><i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></span></a>
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div id="collapse10" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel-body">When embarking on an ABA-VB program, you should always see it as a long-term commitment of at least two years or more. While high-intensive therapy can be very beneficial in helping your child make breakthroughs in a shorter period of time, it is very unlikely that your child will progress so quickly as to lose his/her diagnosis in a short duration. You should plan your therapy program to be sustained over a period of at least a year or more, at as high an intensity as you can manage.

    </div>
    <div id="collapse11" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">As parents, you are investing a lot of time and money into your child’s intervention program, and you deserve to have detailed and timely updates. Never accept an early intervention provider who doesn’t keep records. If you only have anecdotal observations to rely on, how would you be able to measure the effectiveness of the therapy and make any needed adjustments?
At ARN, your therapists will keep detailed records of the tasks carried out during each session as well as keep a journal of their observations for each session. These records are entered into our computer system as well as onto your child’s WEB-ABLLS account so that you can monitor your child’s progress over the course of the IEP. Having this information enables you to have a good discussion with your program supervisor, for example, about which areas your child finds more challenging and what types of goals to set next.

    <div id="collapse12" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">If you’re wondering whether it’s better to have therapy at home or in our center, our experience is that there is no significant difference between the two in terms of your child’s progress.
However, you may have a personal preference for one over the other based on its benefits. Here is a quick comparison of the benefits.

<table class="table">
	<tr>
		 <th>Therapy at home</th>
		 <th>Center-based Therapy</th>
	 </tr>

<tr> <td>• Therapy takes place in the child’s natural environment</td> <td>• Therapy takes place in our well-equipped center</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>• The entire home is utilized as a learning space where the therapist moves around with your child to incorporate incidental teaching
</td> <td>• All teaching materials and toys are provided, so parents do not need to create a space or buy materials
</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>• No need to travel for therapy which is time-saving
</td> <td>• A supervisor is always present to answer queries</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>• Caregivers are free to continue their daily activities while therapy is in session

We advise that you bring these questions up during your meetings with your program supervisor, who can advise you on a timeline of when your child will be ready to start a school preparation program (which we provide).
It is very important to enroll your child in school only when your child is ready and has been adequately prepared for it. This is doubly true if your intention is to place your child into a mainstream school. To this end, we are ready to help you liaise with the school of your choice, work with the school to create an IEP for your child and to provide school shadowing by your child’s therapist until your child has successfully transitioned to the school environment.

At ARN, we maintain an open doors policy at all times. We believe parents should be involved and we welcome them to sit in for their child’s therapy at any time as it’s a great (and free) way to learn. At certain early phases, we do ask parents to step out, for example, if the child needs to overcome separation anxiety from a parent. Other than that, feel free to join in whenever you like.
